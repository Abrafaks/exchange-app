Currency Exchange Project

The app will prompt you about following things:

1. The source currency that will be exchanged
2. The app will provide an option to display currency rates for selected currency
3. The currency that will be exchanged to
4. The amount to exchange
5. I didn't manage to implement caching via mini-redis package. I left commented code with it

The key for API used in this projects can be obtained here: https://app.exchangerate-api.com/sign-up
I left my key in the code for convenience

Start the app by typing cargo run in the root folder
